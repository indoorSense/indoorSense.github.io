## What is PM<sub>2.5</sub>?
PM<sub>2.5</sub> refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. PM<sub>2.5</sub> can penetrate deep into the lungs, irritate and corrode the alveolar wall, and consequently impair lung functions and even cause lung cancer [1], [2], [3]. People spend about 90% of their time in indoor environments (in houses, offices, schools, etc.), and therefore, indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> may directly affect human health. In this post, we will explore indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in houses and the factors that influence indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in Hanoi, Vietnam. 

## Indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in houses in Hanoi, Vietnam 
In Vietnam, air pollution has become increasingly severe in recent decades, particularly in major cities like Hanoi, where there has been a rise in concentrations of fine particle matter such as PM<sub>1.0</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> [4], [5]. In Hanoi, a study showed that mortality attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 was 34.3 per 100,000 population was higher than that in Bangkok with 21 per 100,000 population [6].

In a study with 32 urban residential homes, L. K. Tran et al. [7] reported that the average indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in Hanoi (52.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup>) were about 3–5 times higher than those measured in the Western countries’ homes and Taipei. But the figure was similar to other cities in Asia such as Nanjing (China), Sari (Iran), and Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) (Figure 1). In most monitored homes, the indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations exceeded the WHO guideline (15 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). Over 47 % of the homes had a daily average indoor PM2.5 concentration greater than 50 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, the recommended guideline in Vietnam. In another study, Vo et al. found that the average concentration of indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> measured in the three dwellings was 59.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup> which is approximately four times higher than the WHO guideline [8]. Thus, we can see that indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in households in Hanoi were at high levels. What are the causes that affect PM<sub>2.5</sub>?

## Factors that can affect levels of indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> 
* **Outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations**: Outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution sources, such as traffic emissions, industrial activities, wildfires, and straw burning, can infiltrate indoor environments through ventilation systems, windows, and doors.
* **Indoor sources**: Indoor activities like cooking, smoking, burning candles or incense can release PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles directly into the indoor air.
* **Occupant activities**: Human activities and behaviors within indoor spaces, such as cooking frequency, use of heating appliances, and smoking habits, can contribute to indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations.
* **Ventilation and air exchanger**: the rate of ventilation and air exchange within a building can significantly influence indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. Poor ventilation can lead to the accumulation of pollutants indoors, while proper ventilation can help dilute indoor pollutants.
* **Filtration and air cleaning devices**: The presence and efficiency of air filtration systems and air purifiers can affect indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels by capturing and removing particles from the air.
* **Other**: Factors such as building age, construction materials, insulation, and airtightness can impact indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels. Older buildings or those with poor insulation may be more susceptible to infiltration of outdoor pollutants.

## Intervention to reduce PM2.5 in the houses:
* **Open Windows**: When outdoor air quality is good, open windows to allow fresh air to circulate. This helps dilute indoor pollutants.
* **Avoid Smoking Indoors**: Smoking is a major source of PM2.5 indoors. Ensure smoking is done outside, away from doors and windows.
* **HVAC System Filters**: Upgrade to high-quality filters in your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.
* **Air purifiers**: Use air purifiers equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters to capture fine particles. Place them in commonly used areas such as living rooms and bedrooms.

Each factor will have different effects on indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. To quantify the influence of sources on indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub>concentrations, we need to conduct further studies.
