## Education Background
[2016 - 2023] Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, SOUTH KOREA

[2008 - 2013] The Degree of Engineer in Mechanical Engineering, University of Science and Technology, The University of Da Nang, VIETNAM

## Working Experience
Dr. Ngo Dinh Nhan obtained a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in the Republic of Korea in 2023. Currently, he serves as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center, VinUniversity, Vietnam. His research interest primarily encompasses the development of devices for the collection, detection, and measurement of airborne particles. Throughout his doctoral and postdoctoral studies in South Korea, he successfully developed instruments for sampling and measurement of airborne pathogens and dust particles (PM2.5). Presently, at VinUniversity (Vietnam) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (USA), he is tasked with the creation of a biological pathogen collection and detection device. This project entails the design of a sampling device, and the utilization of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique and novel biosensors for detection purposes.

## Research Interest
[1] Sensors: Acoustic Wave-based Sensors such as Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) for (bio)aerosol measurements

[2] (Bio)aerosols: airborne microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, and fungi) measurements, fine dust (PM2.5) sampling and measurement

[3] Embedded system: microcontrollers (PIC family) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA - Xilinx)-based circuit development for aerosol sensors/devices
